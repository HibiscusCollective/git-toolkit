# 90 Day implementation plan

## 90 day bet

Our primary focus for the next 90 days is to implement the ticket reference feature while building the core libraries that will
support future Git Toolkit functionality. This aligns with our P0 objective of simplifying the addition of ticket references to
commit messages while maintaining compatibility with existing Git workflows.

Given the part-time contribution model (4-8 hours per week), we'll take an incremental, test-driven approach that delivers value
at each milestone.

### Milestones

#### Month 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

##### Week 1-2: Research and Architecture

- Research Git extension vs. Git library bindings approach
- Make architectural decision based on end-user simplicity and performance
- Design the tiered configuration system architecture
- Create initial project structure and workspace setup
- Set up basic test infrastructure

##### Week 3-4: Core Configuration Library

- Implement tiered configuration system supporting:
  - Global user config (~/.config/git-toolkit)
  - Repository-specific config (.git/config or .git-toolkit.toml)
  - Environment variables
  - Command-line arguments
- Write comprehensive tests for configuration loading and precedence
- Document configuration system for future contributors

#### Month 2: Core Functionality (Weeks 5-8)

##### Week 5-6: Template Handling System

- Implement template handling library
- Support configurable ticket reference labels (e.g., "Ref:", "Initiative:")
- Create template parsing and rendering functionality
- Write tests for template system
- Document template system for future contributors

##### Week 7-8: Git Integration

- Implement Git commit message manipulation functionality
- Create integration between configuration, templates, and Git operations
- Write integration tests
- Document Git integration approach

#### Month 3: Ticket Reference Tool (Weeks 9-12)

##### Week 9-10: Ticket CLI Implementation

- Implement the ticket reference command-line tool
- Connect to core libraries for configuration and template handling
- Add command-line argument parsing
- Write end-to-end tests
- Create user documentation

##### Week 11-12: Polish and Release

- Address any bugs or edge cases
- Improve error handling and user feedback
- Create installation instructions
- Prepare for initial release
- Document future enhancement ideas

### Success Criteria

By the end of this 90-day period, we will have:

1. A functioning ticket reference tool that allows users to add configurable ticket references to commit messages
2. Core libraries for configuration and template handling that can be reused for future features
3. A solid foundation for adding additional Git Toolkit features
4. Comprehensive tests and documentation

### Stretch Goals

If we complete the primary milestones ahead of schedule:

1. Begin implementation of the co-author feature
2. Add auto-detection of ticket numbers from branch names
3. Implement interactive selection from recent tickets
4. Add integration with specific project management tools

### Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                                                          | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation                                                          |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Git integration approach proves more complex than anticipated | High   | Medium     | Start with simplest approach (shell commands) and iterate if needed |
| Configuration system becomes overly complex                   | Medium | Medium     | Focus on minimal viable functionality first, then enhance           |
| Limited development time impacts delivery                     | Medium | High       | Prioritize core functionality; be willing to defer stretch goals    |
| User experience issues with initial implementation            | Medium | Low        | Get early feedback from potential users                             |
